The nodes in our graph consist of triples of the form $(l,t,d)$ where $l \in \mathcal{L}$, the set of locations\footnote{Each geographical location gets represented \underline{twice} in the set $\mathcal{L}$, once as an arrival location $l_A$ and once as a departure location $l_D$.}, $t \in \left\{ 0,\dots,\mathcal{N}_{\textrm{periods}}\right\}$, and $d \in \left\{0,\dots,\mathcal{M}_{\textrm{max duty periods}}\right\}$.
