Consider the dynamic mission replanning (DMR) problems \cite{dmr-planning,dmr-execution}. The various variants of these problems consist of a large-scale stage-1 problem which may be viewed as a linear program or as an integer program and several large-scale stage-2 problems (at least one for each scenario) which too may be viewed as linear programs or as integer programs. The key variables in each subproblem are the \textit{itinerary} variables ($x_i$ or $x_{ii'}$ etc) which correspond to different itineraries. An itinerary itself is a path in (discretised) space-time that satisfies several `business rules' (such as respecting crew and aircraft `duty-cycles'). However, these business rules are often difficult to specify in advance, subject to change, or too complicated to incorporate directly into an optimizer. Therefore they are \textit{not} included in the DMR model constraints. In other words, the DMR models work with itineraries that have been filtered to satisfy business rules.

The present article proposes a unified, rational, algorithmic approach for generating itineraries suitable for the various DMR models. We noted above that an itinerary may be viewed as a path in discretised space-time. To incorporate duty-cycle rules, we just add another `dimension' to this (discrete) space-time and construct directed graphs on this set of grid points. The itineraries are then just directed paths in such graphs.

The rest of this article is organised as follows
